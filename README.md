Classic retro Snake Game

The purpose of this program is to make a snake game that has a movable snake character, a coin that can be collected, and a scoring system.

This game will use keyboard input only to control the snake in Snake Game. This game will be made with a module called Pygame, which adds to the programing language. This game features a snake character that goes around to collect coins. Each time the snake collects a coin the snake gets longer and your score will increase by one.
If the snake touches itself, it dies and the game restarts.

The controls are very simple: A:left, S:down, W:up, and D:right
Note that the snake will not turn 180 degree but only 90 degrees. For example: you can't click "a" right after clicking "d".
